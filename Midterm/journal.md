## October 18

Began brainstorming ideas for the game. I wanted to do something that involved an NPC that could learn, so I was playing around with ideas for chatbots. However, I realized that I could try making a Tamagotchi-type pet that would learn from your actions. This pet would initially start off extremely simple, as perhaps nothing more than a blip on the screen, but would over time grow and adapt to environmental changes. I'm not sure if I want there to be a specific goal, but I'd like the player to treat it as a bit of a sandbox and make their own goals. The specifics are not entirely there yet; I'll have to experiment/brainstorm further to reach a more concrete idea.
