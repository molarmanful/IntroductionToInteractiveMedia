# Development Journal

## October 18

Began brainstorming ideas for the game. I wanted to do something that involved an NPC that could learn, so I was playing around with ideas for chatbots. However, I realized that I could try making a Tamagotchi-type pet that would learn from your actions. This pet would initially start off extremely simple, as perhaps nothing more than a blip on the screen, but would over time grow and adapt to environmental changes. I'm not sure if I want there to be a specific goal, but I'd like the player to treat it as a bit of a sandbox and make their own goals. The specifics are not entirely there yet; I'll have to experiment/brainstorm further to reach a more concrete idea.

I think implementation-wise, it would be best if I created a predefined "skill tree" that the NPC would follow throughout its development. By rewarding/punishing certain actions, the player can "train" the NPC to do certain tasks over others. I'm also thinking about randomized starting stats/specializations of some sort.

Some ideas:

- Using food as a primary reward/motivator esp. at the start of the NPC's lifespan (e.g. to help the NPC move around)
- VERY CONTROVERSIAL AND MAY NOT BE GREAT, but I'd also like to explore themes of abuse vs. punishment; neglect, for example, or not feeding food, could serve as punishment but may also stifle growth in certain unintended ways.
- Perhaps an escape mechanic where if the NPC somehow escapes from the area in which you raise it, then the game ends?
