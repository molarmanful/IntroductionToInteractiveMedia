## Concept

For this project, I want to have some sort of publicly-accessible webserver that interfaces with Processing, which then interfaces with Arduino. The idea is that people can access the frontend for the webserver and enter an input of some sort. The server would route the input to Processing, which would then route the input from Processing to the Arduino via serial communication. The Arduino would then interpret the input and act accordingly. In this case, Processing would not necessarily be a visual focus but rather a middleman between the server and the Arduino. At its most ambitious form, I would like to implement a "shell" or "terminal" style of input, allowing users extensive control of the Arduino.
